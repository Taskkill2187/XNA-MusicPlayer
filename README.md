# Installing MusicPlayer
Due to the fact that im too lazy to actually make proper release you can just download the project as a zip (the green button on the top right of this site) and find the 
exectuable file in "XNA-MusicPlayer/MusicPlayer/MusicPlayer/bin/x86/Release/" other things you will need to run the program are:

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914

But you have those already installed if you played one of the following games: Bastion, Celeste, Fez, Hacknet, Magicka, Owlboy, Reus, Rogue Legacy, Solar 1/2, Stardew Valley, Terraria, etc.
You can find the full list here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA

If something doesnt work (which is likely given that I only tested this on like 2 computers) contact me on discord: ╲⎝⧹Niklas⧸⎠╱#7787
# Installing the Browser Extension
After unzipping the downloaded file you will find a folder named "Browser Extension" in "XNA-MusicPlayer/MusicPlayer/MusicPlayer/" just drag and drop it on your browsers extension tab.
