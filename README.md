# Installing MusicPlayer
Due to the fact that im too lazy to actually make proper release you can just download the project as a zip (the green button on the top right of this site) and find the 
exectuable file in "XNA-MusicPlayer/MusicPlayer/MusicPlayer/bin/x86/Release/" other things you will need to run the program are:

If something doesnt work (which is likely given that I only tested this on like 2 computers) contact me on discord: ╲⎝⧹Niklas⧸⎠╱#7787
# Installing the Browser Extension
After unzipping the downloaded file you will find a folder named "Chrome¦Opera Extension" just drag and drop it on your browsers extension tab.
